##  Features

- Realistic models of all 8 planets, their moons, asteroid belt, and the Sun
- Orbiting International Space Station (GLTF model)
- Two camera modes ( in rework ):  
  - **Orbit** (drag & zoom)  
  - **Freecam** (WASD + mouse look)
- Interactive UI panel to control:
  - Simulation speed
  - Zoom and planet size
  - Camera modes
  - Planet info and labels
-  Planet-specific audio narrations with mute/pause
- Scientific descriptions for each body with expandable panels
- Real-time Earth-based clock showing time, days, and years
- Dynamic camera follow system with smooth transitions ( In work)
